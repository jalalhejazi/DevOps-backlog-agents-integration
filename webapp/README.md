## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Responsive Design Complexity
**Issue**: Creating a layout that works seamlessly across all device sizes while maintaining visual hierarchy.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented CSS Grid with auto-fit and minmax for flexible layouts
- Used clamp() function for fluid typography that scales smoothly
- Created multiple breakpoints with mobile-first approach
- Implemented container queries for modern browser support

### Challenge 2: CSS3 Feature Integration
**Issue**: Balancing modern CSS features with browser compatibility.

**Solution**:
- Used CSS custom properties with fallback values
- Implemented progressive enhancement for advanced features
- Added vendor prefixes where necessary (-webkit-backdrop-filter)
- Created graceful degradation for older browsers

### Challenge 3: Testing Static HTML Application
**Issue**: Setting up comprehensive tests for a static HTML page with server requirements.

**Solution**:
- Created dual testing approach: static HTML tests and server tests
- Used Puppeteer for real browser testing and interaction validation
- Implemented async server startup and cleanup in test suite
- Added comprehensive accessibility and responsive design testing

### Challenge 4: Performance vs. Visual Appeal
**Issue**: Maintaining fast load times while implementing rich visual effects.

**Solution**:
- Embedded CSS to reduce HTTP requests
- Used efficient CSS animations with transform properties
- Implemented reduced motion support for accessibility
- Optimized CSS with minimal redundancy

### Challenge 5: Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Issue**: Ensuring consistent appearance across different browsers.

**Solution**:
- Used modern CSS with progressive enhancement
- Added vendor prefixes for experimental features
- Implemented fallbacks for advanced features like backdrop-filter
- Tested with multiple viewport sizes and orientations

## Dependencies Explanation

### Runtime Dependencies
- **http-server**: Lightweight static file server for testing and deployment

### Development Dependencies
- **jest**: Testing framework for unit and integration tests
- **puppeteer**: Browser automation for end-to-end testing
- **@jest/globals**: Jest globals for modern JavaScript testing

## Browser Support

- **Modern Browsers**: Full feature support (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- **Legacy Browsers**: Graceful degradation with core functionality maintained
- **Mobile Browsers**: Optimized for iOS Safari and Chrome Mobile

## Future Enhancements

While all requirements are met, potential improvements could include:
