## Description

Create a Docker container for the HTML/CSS webapp to standardize the development environment and ensure consistent builds across different development machines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Docker container builds successfully without errors
- [x] Container runs the webapp and serves content on specified port
- [x] Basic container functionality tests pass
- [x] Dockerfile follows best practices for lightweight images

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing webapp structure and dependencies
2. Create optimized Dockerfile using Node.js Alpine base
3. Implement security best practices (non-root user, health checks)
4. Create comprehensive test suite for Docker functionality
5. Add Docker Compose for easy development setup
6. Update package.json with Docker-related scripts
7. Create documentation for Docker usage

## Implementation Notes

### Approach Taken
- Used Node.js 18 Alpine as base image for lightweight container (~180MB vs ~1GB for full Node.js)
- Implemented security best practices with non-root user execution
- Added comprehensive health checks for container monitoring
- Created automated test suite to validate all acceptance criteria

### Features Implemented
- **Dockerfile**: Optimized multi-stage build with proper caching
- **Docker Compose**: Easy development and deployment setup
- **Test Suite**: Automated validation of container functionality
- **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring for container health
- **Security**: Non-root user execution and minimal attack surface

### Technical Decisions
- **Base Image**: Node.js 18 Alpine for minimal size and security
- **Port**: Exposed port 1234 to match existing application configuration
- **User**: Created dedicated nodejs user for security
- **Health Check**: Used wget for lightweight health monitoring
- **Caching**: Optimized layer caching by copying package.json first

### Files Modified/Added
- `webapp/Dockerfile` - Main container definition
- `webapp/.dockerignore` - Optimize build context
- `webapp/docker-compose.yml` - Development environment setup
- `webapp/docker-test.sh` - Comprehensive test suite
- `webapp/DOCKER.md` - Documentation and usage guide
- `webapp/package.json` - Added Docker-related npm scripts

### Testing Results
All acceptance criteria validated:
- ✅ Container builds successfully (tested with `docker build`)
- ✅ Application serves on port 1234 (verified with curl tests)
- ✅ Basic functionality confirmed (HTML content validation)
- ✅ Best practices implemented (security, size optimization, health checks)
