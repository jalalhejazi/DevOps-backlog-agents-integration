## Description

Create a Docker container for the HTML/CSS webapp to standardize the development environment and ensure consistent builds across different development machines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Docker container builds successfully without errors
- [x] Container runs the webapp and serves content on specified port
- [x] Basic container functionality tests pass
- [x] Dockerfile follows best practices for lightweight images

## Implementation Notes

### Original Implementation (Superseded by task-5)
This task was initially implemented with Node.js-based Docker container, which was then enhanced in task-5 with nginx reverse proxy for better performance and production readiness.

### Task Evolution
- **Task 4**: Basic Docker containerization with Node.js http-server
- **Task 5**: Enhanced with nginx reverse proxy for production optimization

The final implementation (task-5) includes all task-4 requirements plus significant performance and security improvements through nginx integration.
